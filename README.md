# etchSketch
Welcome to my Etch-A-Sketch!
This is 
The Odin Projects fundamentals course project.

For this project, I had to create a grid and fill it using a loop.
Use CSS FlexBox and Grid. Plus an array of other CSS tools to achieve the desired style.
Knowledge of eventListeners and DOM manipulation were needed in order to complete the project.
Google web dev tools were also used quite often to assess bugs.

Have a look and play around. https://jcrain5418.github.io/etchSketch/
